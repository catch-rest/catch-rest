## How to use &#x1F379;

Click here, and this README disappears letting you type.

First of all, you can send HTTP requests, pass parameters, inspect responses.

Whatever you type is captured as part of the URL in the address bar, easy to pass around!

### Formats auto-detection

Catch REST &#x1F379; doesn't only do HTTP requests, you can just use it as a simple Notes app.

To make it even cooler, I've implemented formatting for plain text.

Wait, formatting for 𝙥𝙡𝙖𝙞𝙣 𝙩𝙚𝙭𝙩??

Oh yes, wicked Unicode magic.
